### What I learned

This was an introductory challenge to get used to working on real world projects again.

The main goal with this challenge was just to get used to working with CSS again after an extended break, and to push myself to use techniques I have used in other practical projects.

Funnily enough the thing that actually required the most effort was just finding a simple solution for making sure I could have the content centered and the footer always at the bottom. Usually I have a nice header, main, footer layout that makes it easy but since there is no header in this case it just took some rethinking.


### Continued development

I would like to revist this in the future and update it into a react component.
